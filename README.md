MVC is central to a good design for a Cocoa application. The benefits of adopting this pattern are numerous. Many objects in these applications tend to be more reusable, and their interfaces tend to be better defined. Applications having an MVC design are also more easily extensible than other applications. Moreover, this is a small project and MVC is a very common and easy-to-implement design pattern. Thats why I choose MVC pattern.
